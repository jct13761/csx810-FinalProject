To-Do:
Implement Boids
- separation: steer to avoid crowding local flock-mates.
- alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flock-mates.
- cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flock-mates

Create Boids Playground
Add compute shader
Add collision detection for boids
Make bids have cool shape (Birds, Fish, etc.) / Make Random Color boids
